## Features Implementation

Fill up the table below based on the **features** that you want us to grade you with. You may implement more features than what you can afford as your feature points, so you can select the features that we can grade. Feature prerequisite rule should apply.

You are free to transform the table below into short paragraphs if youâ€™d like. The goal is to ensure that we **can find** and **confirm** each node implementation.

### Feature Analysis

47:
- The menu of the game is designed to look like a task assigned to the Player, it gives the player motivation and interest to want to find out more. It gave us a background knowledge of the story behind the game, and also supporting the core drive, epic meaning, as player believe that they are chosen to do something, in this case to save the princess. 

62:
- In the last scene of the game, the NPC interacts with the player through dialogue, and the story ends with a plot twist, the Princess actually doesn't want to be saved. This incorporates storytelling in the game and entertain the Player with an unusual ending.

73:
- Singleton Pattern is implemented for managing global game state, it is useful for global variables and functions that many other classes need to access. This improves code maintenance overall and it is easier implementing more features and adjustments in the future.

## Notes

Future Improvements: 
- Have multiple choices and more dialogue.
- Add secret room and different endings.
